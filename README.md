# 🐍 Contribution Snake

![Snake animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kartiknahare/kartiknahare/output/snake.svg)

## 🎮 Interactive Snake Game on My Contribution Graph!

The snake eats my GitHub contributions and grows based on my coding activity. Watch it slither through my commit history!

### How it works:
- 🟩 Green squares = High contribution days (snake food!)
- ⬜ Light squares = Low contribution days  
- 🐍 Snake moves through the contribution graph
- The more I code, the more food for the snake!
